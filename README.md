# UOCIS322 - Project 1 #

Author: David Moe

The project is intended for us to make a mini web page. We have a python file named pageserver.py and in 
this file we can see that it has serveral functions, one of which needed to be edited so that we could
specify which file we can accept. A valid file must have no: ".." or "~", exist in the pages/ directory.

The project requires the commands such as:

make start

make stop

kill

make veryclean

*optional curl*



All you have to do to run the files to see if the html is working is use "curl IPv4 (or IPv6) Address: port number" this is after you do make start.
